# microP
This repository contains documents and designs, describing the components and working principle of a microprocessor.
The first version was written in January 2019. I later on noticed there were many mistakes in it, which explains the revised version of February 2021.

The designs were made using the logic circuit simulator "Logicly". You can download it(free-trial version available) at the following link: https://logic.ly/ .

The goal of the project is to design and build a full 4-bit computer. So far, I haven't had enough time to complete it, but I'll keep you updated.
Thank you all!
